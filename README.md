HACKATHON SYNOPSIS

The theme of this hackathon is Old School. We have created a retro-style arcade game collection that brings back the nostalgia of the golden age of arcade gaming from the 90’s using Python and Pygame and with an energetic sound track as well. The games are designed to emulate the look and feel of the original arcade machines, complete with authentic sound effects and pixelated graphics. 
It is a perfect way for players to relive the glory days of arcade gaming and for younger players to experience the games that defined an era.

SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:

1)Install python in your computer from the official website ‘https://www.python.org/downloads/’.
2)Install the python package manager ‘pip’ by using get-pip.py (https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py)  and store it in the same directory where python is installed.
3)Once you have pip installed, use the command ‘pip install pygame’ to install the pygame library in your computer.
4)Now install the game files from the Github repositories and have fun.

“Arcade Adventure" brings together three classic arcade games - Pong, Archery, and Space Invaders - into one thrilling and nostalgic experience. The Pong portion of the game will feature the classic gameplay that has been entertaining players for decades. The player will use paddles to hit a ball back and forth, competing against the computer. The game will feature different difficulty levels to keep the gameplay fresh and exciting. 

In the Archery section, players will take on the role of an archer, using a bow and arrow to aim and shoot at targets. The game will feature multiple levels, each with a different set of targets and challenges. Players will be able to earn points for accuracy and speed, and compete for the highest score. 

Finally, the Space Invaders section will challenge players to defend their base from waves of alien invaders(with a surprise here). Using a spaceship, players will have to blast their way through the alien hordes, earning points for each invader they take down. Players will have limited lives and the game will go on till the player uses up all his lives.

All of this has been combined in an interactive menu page.

 "Arcade Adventure" will feature vibrant, retro-style graphics and a dynamic soundtrack that will transport players back to the golden age of arcade gaming. It is a fun, nostalgic and thrilling game that will appeal to players of all ages and skill levels. It's a perfect addition to any arcade or gaming collection, providing hours of entertainment and competition.
